# WetSuite NLP crash course

Welcome to the WetSuite NLP crash course! This small crash course aims to get anyone started with deploying NLP-based tools to research governmental documents.

# For whom is this crash course intended?
This crash course is designed for (legal) scholars who want to learn how to use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques in their research. Prior techincal skills or knowledge are not required.
However, you must be open to try and learn new things!

# What will I learn in the crash course?

- Part 0: How to run Python code in Jupyter Notebooks, either online or on your local computer.
- Part 1: How to use the `wetsuite` Python library to access sample datasets.

# What do I need to have or know before I can start on the crash course?
First of all, you need to have access to a computer with internet access.

The crash course uses the Python programming language, which is the language of choice for NLP-applications in both research and industry.

# Helpful resources
In case you get stuck, the following resources might be helpful:

- the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)
- online introductory courses on Python, such as [Codecademy's "Learn Python 3" course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3) or [Kaggle's "Learn Python" course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python).

# I'm done with the crash course and want to learn more
