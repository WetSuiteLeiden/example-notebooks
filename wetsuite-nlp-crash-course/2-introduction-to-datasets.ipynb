    "\n",
    "Welcome to part 2 of the WetSuite NLP crash course. Make sure that you've read the [full introduction]((https://github.com/WetSuiteLeiden/example-notebooks/tree/main/wetsuite-nlp-crash-course)) and worked through part 1 before you start on this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose of this notebook\n",
    "In part two of this series, we show how to install the `wetsuite-core` library for use in your Python Notebook (or project). Then we show how to interact with one of the ready-made sample datasets provided by WetSuite.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of legal datasets\n",
    "A lot of different legal datasets exist (TODO: reference the website here). The `wetsuite-core` library provides an easier interface to interact with some datasets. For each of these datasets, WetSuite also provides ready-made sample datasets which can help you practice your technical skills and show what's possible. The sample datasets are incomplete, as most datasets are quite big. Furthermore, the sample datasets won't be updated: they remain static. If you want to use the wetsuite-core library with more complete or up-to-date datasets, you will need to download this yourself (TODO: Reference how you can download other parts of the datasets yourself).\n",
    "\n",
    "## WetSuite sample datasets\n",
    "The sample datasets that are provided by WetSuite and accessible through the `wetsuite-core` exist to help you get started with programming and NLP research. The datasets are not complete and thus not fit to use in actual research. However, the datasets are based on larger and existing datasets which are complete and can be used for legal research. The things you learn in our notebooks should help you to create the tools you need for your research.\n",
    "\n",
    "The WetSuite sample datasets are:\n",
    "* Parliamentary data: a subset Dutch parliamentary data, in the XML format as provided by the Dutch government.\n",
    "* Court decisions: court decisions of about 2,5 year as provided by the Dutch Judicial Council (Raad voor de rechtspraak) in the original XML format.\n",
    "* Decisions by the Dutch Gambling Authority (Kansspelautoriteit) in a plaintext format\n",
    "* Dutch legislation in the XML format as provided by the Dutch government through the API's of wetten.overheid.nl.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "* WetSuite provides code to access some legal datasets in the `wetsuite-core` library.\n",
    "* WetSuite provides some small ready-made sample datasets which can also be accessed directly via the `wetsuite-core` library.\n",
    "* This series of notebooks aim to illustrate how to use Python to apply NLP-methods for legal research.\n"
