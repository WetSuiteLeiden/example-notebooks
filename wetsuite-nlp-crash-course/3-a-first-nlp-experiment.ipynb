This third part is a simplified version of the quantitative experiment done in Martijn Staal's bachelor thesis [_De memorie van toelichting overvraagd?_](https://martijn-staal.nl/nl/blog/de-memorie-van-toelichting-overvraagd). In this thesis, Martijn wanted to research how parliamentary documents (the _Kamerstukken_) are actually used in Dutch legal practice. One way to research this is to analyze how often such documents are cited in legal documents. The method he employed was to automatically search for such citations in legal cases and legal literature.\n",

To research such more specific things, you will need the metadata.\n",

If the textual patterns you are looking for reach this point, then there are generally two possible approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first approach for finding (and making sense of) complex textual patterns is to use a _parser_ for the pattern you are looking for. A [parser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing#Parser) is a piece of software that reads some input text and converts it to a formal structure as defined by a certain _grammar_. The grammar is the definition of your textual pattern. Existing parsing libraries can then be used to generate a parser based on your grammar. [Lark](https://github.com/lark-parser/lark) is for example a parsing toolkit for use with Python. With a grammar, you can more easily describe complex patterns. [Here is an example of a Lark grammar for Dutch parliamentary citations](https://github.com/mastaal/nllegalcit/blob/main/nllegalcit/grammars/parlementair.lark) (which is - even with nearly a hundred lines - still not complete for all possible citations!). Another useful features of parsers is that you can also easily extract information from the text snippets that matched your pattern. This is what [the nllegalcit library uses to extract specific information about a citation to the Kamerstukken](https://nllegalcit.martijn-staal.nl/latest/nllegalcit.html#nllegalcit.KamerstukCitation).\n",
    "\n",
    "The second approach is to use tools based on machine learning to find the textual snippets you are looking for. For this you will generally need quite an expansive dataset of annotated examples so that you can train a model to accurately recognize the textual pattern. This approach might be useful when it is hard to precisely define what textual pattern you are looking for.\n",
    "\n",
