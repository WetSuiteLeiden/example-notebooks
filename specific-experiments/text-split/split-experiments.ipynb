Deze woning is opgeleverd op 21 november 2018. Op 24 februari 2020 heeft [verzoeker] bij [verweerder] melding gemaakt van lekkages rondom het kozijn van de openslaande deuren en een slaapkamerraam. Ondanks dat [verzoeker] [verweerder] diverse keren in gebreke heeft gesteld, is [verweerder] nog steeds niet tot herstel overgegaan. [verzoeker] heeft in oktober 2020 een deskundige ingeschakeld. Deze deskundige stelt dat de oorzaak van de lekkages is gelegen in het niet juist aanbrengen van de lateislabbe, het ontbreken van een waterkerende laag op de stellaten en het niet hoog genoeg opmetselen van het gevelmetselwerk ter plaatse van het dakoverstek. [verweerder] heeft daarna endoscopisch onderzoek verricht in de spouwmuur, echter zonder resultaat. Daarna heeft [verweerder] geen werkzaamheden meer uitgevoerd. Een door [verzoeker] ingeschakelde aannemer heeft een herstelplan opgesteld, wat aan [verweerder] is voorgelegd. Ook hierop heeft [verweerder] niet gereageerd. In maart 2022 heeft [verzoeker] opnieuw melding gemaakt van lekkages, waarbij is gebleken dat in alle kozijnen verhoogde vochtwaardes aanwezig waren. Het risico is groot dat het inwendige houtbouwskelet inmiddels vochtig is en wordt aantast, met mogelijk houtrot tot gevolg. Ook is er sprake van uitgescheurde in- en uitwendige stuchoeken. [verweerder] betwist dat er sprake is van verzuim en dat het werk conform het ontwerp is uitgevoerd, zodat er sprake zou zijn van ontwerpfouten in plaats van uitvoeringsfouten. [verzoeker] heeft er dan ook recht en belang bij om in een voorlopig deskundigenbericht te laten onderzoeken of er sprake is van gebreken en om zijn rechtspositie te kunnen bepalen.'</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\"><pre>{'hints': ['is-title'],\n",

Zo nee, op welke wijze is er afgeweken van de bestektekeningen?    Is een onderzoek naar de vermeende lekkages mogelijk zonder dat er een destructief onderzoek plaatsheeft? Kunt u uw antwoord motiveren?       Kozijnen     Kunt u vaststellen dat er sprake is van lekkages bij de openslaande deuren en de slaapkamerramen? Kunt u alle andere kozijnen beoordelen en bezien sprake is van lekkages dan wel details als bij de kozijnen onder a. zijn toegepast en/of elk kozijn op dezelfde wijze als de kozijnen onder a. is aangebracht? Zo ja, kunt u aangeven of het waarschijnlijk is dat als gevolg hiervan ook lekkages kunnen ontstaan ter plaatse van deze overige kozijnen?  Zijn de lekkages te herleiden tot het ontwerp/bestek dan wel tot de uitvoering van het werk? Indien dit te herleiden is tot de uitvoering van het werk kunt u vaststellen dat deze lekkages te herleiden zijn tot het werk dat door [verweerder] is uitgevoerd, of kunnen de lekkages een andere oorzaak hebben, bijvoorbeeld in het materiaal of in het werk van derden?  Wat is uw technische visie ten aanzien van het gekozen ontwerp (rollaag) in combinatie met de toepassing van kunststof kozijnen?  Indien er sprake is van een ontwerpfout, had de aannemer daar naar uw mening voor moeten waarschuwen en is daarbij nog relevant dat [verzoeker] ook de rol van uitvoerder / opzichter had?  Is herstel van het geconstateerde gebrek c.q. de geconstateerde gebreken mogelijk?  Zo ja, kunt u bevestigen dat herstel mogelijk is op een wijze dat het aanzicht van de gevels zoveel mogelijk intact blijft en dat na uitvoering van het door Keurhuis Nederland getoetste plan van aanpak van [naam 2] sprake is van deugdelijk herstel?    Zo nee, kunt u in dat geval een deugdelijke wijze van herstel bepalen, rekening houdend met de kans op schade aan de gevels van de woning en kozijnen en eventueel herstel daarvan?  Kunt u de herstelkosten begroten en deze nader specificeren?  Is er sprake van gevolgschade als gevolg van de vochttoetreding in de woning daar waar de lekkages zich reeds hebben voorgedaan, bijvoorbeeld aan de houtconstructie? Zo ja, welke, en op welke wijze, dient herstel van schade plaats te vinden en wat zijn de herstelkosten?  Hoe groot schat u het risico op gevolgschade in als gevolg van mogelijke toekomstige lekkages rondom de kozijnen waar zich reeds lekkages hebben voorgedaan en voordoen alsmede rondom de overige kozijnen van de woning, indien en voor zover herstel van de geconstateerde gebreken niet wordt uitgevoerd?       Stuchoeken     Kunt u vaststellen dat er sprake is van uitscheuren van stuchoeken? Zo ja, is dit te herleiden tot het ontwerp/bestek dan wel tot de uitvoering van het werk? Indien dit te herleiden is tot de uitvoering van het werk kunt u vaststellen dat deze lekkages te herleiden zijn tot het werk dat door [verweerder] is uitgevoerd, of kunnen de lekkages een andere oorzaak hebben, bijvoorbeeld in het materiaal of in het werk van derden.  Wat is de invloed van normale slijtage, gebruik en tijdsverloop op de vermeende schade aan het stucwerk?  Is herstel van het geconstateerde gebrek c.q. de geconstateerde gebreken mogelijk? Zo ja, kunt u in dat geval een deugdelijke wijze van herstel bepalen, rekening houdend met de kans op schade aan de gevels van de woning  en eventueel herstel daarvan?  Kunt u de herstelkosten begroten en deze nader specificeren?       Goot     Is er sprake van een  lekkage van de gootconstructie in de linker zijgevel? Zo ja, is dit te herleiden tot het ontwerp/bestek dan wel tot de uitvoering van het werk? Indien dit te herleiden is tot de uitvoering van het werk kunt u vaststellen dat deze lekkages te herleiden zijn tot het werk dat door [verweerder] is uitgevoerd, of kunnen de lekkages een andere oorzaak hebben, bijvoorbeeld in het materiaal of in het werk van derden.  Kunt u de herstelkosten begroten en nader specificeren?  Kunt u uitsluiten dat dit probleem zich kan voordoen bij de gootconstructie in de rechter zijgevel?  Indien er sprake is van een ontwerpfout, had de aannemer daar naar uw mening voor moeten waarschuwen en is daarbij nog relevant dat [verzoeker] ook de rol van uitvoerder / opzichter had?
