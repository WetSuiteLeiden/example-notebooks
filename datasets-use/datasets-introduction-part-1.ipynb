        "WetSuite provides tools to more easily use existing legal datasets. In this series of example notebooks, we explain which datasets can be accessed via the `wetsuite-core` library, and how you can use this to speed up your research.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Types of legal datasets\n",
        "A lot of different legal datasets exist (TODO: reference the website here). The `wetsuite-core` library provides an easier interface to interact with some datasets. For each of these datasets, WetSuite also provides ready-made sample datasets which can help you practice your technical skills and show what's possible. The sample datasets are incomplete, as most datasets are quite big. Furthermore, the sample datasets won't be updated: they remain static.\n",
        "\n",
        "## WetSuite sample datasets\n",
        "The sample datasets that are provided by WetSuite and accessible through the `wetsuite-core` exist to help you get started with programming and NLP research. The datasets are not complete and thus not fit to use in actual research. However, the datasets are based on larger and existing datasets which are complete and can be used for legal research. The things you learn in our notebooks should help you to create the tools you need for your research.\n",
        "\n",
        "The WetSuite sample datasets are:\n",
        "* Parliamentary data: a subset Dutch parliamentary data, in the XML format as provided by the Dutch government.\n",
        "* Court decisions: court decisions of about 2,5 year as provided by the Dutch Judicial Council (Raad voor de rechtspraak) in the original XML format.\n",
        "* Decisions by the Dutch Gambling Authority (Kansspelautoriteit) in a plaintext format\n",
        "* Dutch legislation in the XML format as provided by the Dutch government through the API's of wetten.overheid.nl.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Purpose of this notebook\n",
        "In this first part, we show how to install the `wetsuite-core` library for use in your Python Notebook (or project). Then we show how to interact with the ready-made sample datasets provided by WetSuite.\n",
        "\n",
        "## What you need\n",

        "Besides this, the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/) can prove very helpful. If you want a more step-by-step and guided introduction to Python, plenty of online courses exists; for example [Codecademy's \"Learn Python 3\" course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3).\n",
