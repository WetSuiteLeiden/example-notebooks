# example-notebooks

This repository contains all example notebooks of the WetSuite project. These example notebooks aim to show you how
to use the code provided by WetSuite and others to help you leverage NLP tools in legal research.

## What is WetSuite?

## Where should I start?

Start with our curated [crash course](wetsuite-nlp-crash-course/)! This small crash course
aims to get anyone started with deploying NLP-based tools to research governmental documents.

## What can I find here?

### [`wetsuite-nlp-crash-course`](wetsuite-nlp-crash-course)


### [`getting-started-technically`](getting-started-technically)
Addresses some of the more technical, computery questions you may have while starting your own programming projects, such as
 - how do I install this
 - how do I maybe experiment with this _without_ installing anything (a.k.a. 'what are notebooks'

### [`research-methods`](research-methods)
Examples of how to do certain text analysis, such as 
 - how to use existing NLP libraries on bare text
 - how to get text out of more and less cooperative PDFs
 - how to extract interesting information
 - how to extract interesting phrases
 - how to group similar documents

### [`datasets-use`](datasets-use)
Primarily some "load a dataset we provide, start doing something with it",
to show what dealing with data might look like, such as:
- try to extract definition lists that are used in laws
- look at the structure of CVDR documents, and extract text _while retaining information about where it came from_ 
- try to extract information from kansspelautoriteit text
- try to extract just the "this is what we decided and how" from responses to Woo requests

### [`specific-experiments`](specific-experiments)
Some little projects that are not centrally important,
or examples of methods, 
but which you may nonetheless find interesting, 
such as 
- inspecting documents structure in more detail
- how do I split up existing documents into parts
- how do I find legal references in documents
