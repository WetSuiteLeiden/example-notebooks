# example-notebooks

This repository contains all example notebooks of the WetSuite project. These example notebooks aim to show you how
to use the code provided by WetSuite and others to help you leverage NLP tools in legal research.

## What is WetSuite?

## Where should I start?

Start with our curated [crash course](wetsuite-nlp-crash-course/)! This small crash course
aims to get anyone started with deploying NLP-based tools to research governmental documents.

## What can I find here?

### [`wetsuite-nlp-crash-course`](wetsuite-nlp-crash-course)


### [`geting-started-technically`](geting-started-technically)
Addresses some of the more technical, computery questions you may have while starting your own programming projects.

### [`datasets-use`](datasets-use)
Examples of how to interact with legal datasets, primarily yet not only example datasets that we provide.

### [`research-methods`](research-methods)
Examples of how to do certain text analysis, sych s how to use existing NLP libraries.

### [`specific-experiments`](specific-experiments)
Some little projects that are not centrally important,
or examples of methods, but which you may nonetheless find interesting, 
such as finding legal references in documents,
poking at specific documents structure in detail.
