# example-notebooks

This repository contains all example notebooks of the WetSuite project. These example notebooks aim to show you how
to use the code provided by WetSuite and others to help you leverage NLP tools in legal research.

## What is WetSuite?

## What can I find here?

### `datasets-use`
In the `datasets-use` folder, you can find examples of how to interact with possible existing legal datasets,
primarily yet not only some example datasets we provide.


### `research-methods`
The `research-methods` folder contains examples of how to use existing NLP libraries.


### `specific-experiments`
The `specific-experiments` are some little projects
that are not centrally important but which you may find interesting, 
such as finding legal references in documents,
poking at specific documents structure in detail.
