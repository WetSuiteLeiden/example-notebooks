# WetSuite's example-notebooks

This repository contains all example notebooks of the WetSuite project. These example notebooks aim to show you how to use the code provided by WetSuite and others to help you leverage NLP tools in legal research.

## Where should I start?

**Start with our [WetSuite NLP crash course](wetsuite-nlp-crash-course/)!** This small 3-part crash course aims to get anyone started with deploying NLP-based tools to research governmental documents, regardless of your background or prior experience.

Once you've finished the crash course, be curious and look through all the example we provide here - or that others have made elsewhere online. You can also get in touch via our community [TODO ADD URL HERE]!

## What can I find here?

Each folder has its own README that clarifies what you can find there. Be sure to browse around!
