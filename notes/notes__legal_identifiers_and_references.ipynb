    "primarily used for references to laws (and sometimes to regulations and other things).\n",

    "\n",
    "This means 1.2's references with just geldigheidsdatum would not be unambiguous for these cases. \n",
    "At the very least, we would need a clearly defined way of dealing with such cases.\n",
