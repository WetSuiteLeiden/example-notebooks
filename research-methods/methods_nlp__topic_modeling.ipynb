Kortom, met een algeheel verbod wordt niet de juiste doelgroep aangepakt.\\nIk wil daarom pleiten voor een '  verantwoordelijkheidstest'. Een dergelijke test kan vergeleken worden met bijvoorbeeld de spelregeltest die amateurvoetballers dienen af te leggen. De test is bedoeld om het inzicht, gevaarherkenning en kennis omtrent consumentenvuurwerk van de deelnemer te testen en kan beloond worden met een certificaat of QR code, zoals we die inmiddels wel kennen. Dit certificaat dient te worden gecontroleerd wanneer de consument   wil kopen. Wanneer iemand   afsteekt zonder een dergelijk certificaat of illegaal   in het bezit heeft dan kan deze persoon bestraft worden met een geldboete en het afnemen van het certificaat.

Bij de recente jaarwisseling was een   van kracht, ook nu zagen we weer hoe het   onder het volk leeft en wordt gekoesterd. Ook voor de middenstand en de belasting is   een welkome inkomsten bron en uiteraard voor de werkgelegenheid. Gaan we legaal particulier   verbieden dan zal er naar ander   gezocht worden wat bij lange na niet geschikt is en de veiligheid in het geding komt. Vuurwerk geschikt voor particulier gebruik hoort net als vele andere feestelijke tradities bij oudjaarsavond. Kom zelf uit een generatie waar we genoten van   op oudjaaravond en samenzijn met familie en vrienden om zo te proosten op wederom een gezond en succesvol jaar en afgesloten met een bescheiden stukje  . Zelf zie ik bij een algeheel   een zwaardere maatschappelijke druk ontstaan omdat dan de verkoop onderhands en vanuit het buitenland de kop op steekt en er géén enkele controle meer is. Bij veilig bevonden en gekeurd particulier   is de verkoop te handhaven en controleerbaarder dan wanneer dit in de illegaliteit ontstaat bij een algeheel verbod.\\nPersoonlijk ben ik dan ook van mening dat er meer voordeel te behalen is door het   van tafel te vegen.')\n",

Wanneer dit niet meer mag zal een grote hoeveelheid van deze mensen naar alternatieven gaan zoeken om toch   te kunnen kopen en afsteken.\\nDenk hierbij aan illegaal   of het zelf fabriceren van explosieven met alle gevolgen van dien. Illegaal   is makkelijk te verkrijgen en wanneer het verkopen en afsteken van veilig en gekeurd siervuurwerk verbannen wordt zal de handel in illegaal   drastisch toenemen. Dit betekend veel zwaardere letsel, nog meer vandalisme aan straatmeubilair en dan nog maar te zwijgen over de nog extremere geluidsoverlast die mens en dier zullen gaan ervaren.\\nDaarnaast is er bij de politie onvoldoende capaciteit een verbod te handhaven. Ook controles op vervoer van (illegaal)   op de grenzen van onze buurlanden is een jaarlijks terugkomend probleem. Het bewijs hiervan is terug te zien in de afgelopen 2 jaarwisselingen toen ook al een algemeen   aan de orde was. Massaal werd er bijna in elke hoek van de straat   afgestoken en politie kon geen tot nauwelijks grip krijgen op de situatie.\\nDe politie en vele gemeentes zien daarom als alternatief een centrale  /laser/lichtshow maar ook dit bied geen realistische oplossing gezien het feit dat er niet genoeg geld en opgeleide pyrotechnici zij om in elke gemeente of regio van een show te organiseren. Ook steken veel vuurwerkliefhebbers liever zelf hun eigen potje af in de straat, een professionele  /lasershow ontneemt dat.\\nUit cijfers blijkt dat rond de jaarwisseling alcohol de grootste boosdoener is en niet het  . Er vallen veel meer slachtoffers door alcohol dan door  . Daarom stel ik voor meer de focus daarop te richten in plaats van alle pijlen te richten op het legale Nederlandse siervuurwerk en dat de schuld geven van alle problemen.')\n",

Gesuggereerd wordt ook dat centrale vuurwerkshows een mooi alternatief zijn voor   afsteken door consumenten. Dat zie ik toch anders. Niet iedereen is in de gelegenheid om naar zo'n centrale plek te gaan (bijv. als je kleine kinderen hebt, slecht ter been bent e.d.). Daarnaast is de charme van op straat naar   kijken dat het wordt gecombineerd met een praatje en elkaar nieuwjaar wensen met de buren. De buren zijn niet vindbaar bij een grote samenkomst centraal. Daarnaast zal de handhaafbaarheid verbeteren bij een totaalverbod (geen uitzonderingenlijst hanteren zoals de RvS terecht stelt), maar zullen liefhebbers het sneller gaan zoeken bij illegaal   uit andere landen. Dat was al merkbaar tijdens oud en nieuw afgelopen twee keer toen er een   was. \\nDaarom is er een veel beter alternatief. Maak lokale vuurwerkverenigingen mogelijk op buurtniveau (niet wijkniveau). Liefhebbers kunnen dan onder strikte voorwaarden   aanschaffen en afsteken met oud en nieuw. Bijvoorbeeld doordat ze een cursus moeten volgen e.d. Zij kunnen dat dan met elkaar in de buurt afsteken, waardoor mensen nabij ook van het   kunnen genieten. Dit zorgt dat je samen met buren en buurtgenoten kan genieten en een praatje kan maken. Tevens zal de liefhebber minder de neiging hebben om in verenigingsverband illegaal   uit het buitenland te halen.\\nIk heb de indruk dat de voorgestelde wet wat openingen biedt om dit mogelijk te maken, maar niet heel goed daarop past. Volgens mij vraagt het aanpassing van de voorgestelde wet waarin het initiatief voor vuurwerkverenigingen goed in geregeld wordt.\")\n",

De overlast wordt veroorzaakt door relschoppers die illegaal zwaar   afsteken en moedwillig vernielingen aanrichten en zich tegen hulpverleners richten.

Een   in NL zal dit niet wegnemen, eerder vergroten. Afgelopen jaarwisseling zagen we hoe goed zo'n verbod werkt. In onze wijk was er vrijwel evenveel   als voor het verbod. Daaruit blijkt het plezier van het   dat hoort bij de jaarwisseling. Bij een verbod zal een groep gaan grijpen naar dit alternatief via Duitsland, Belgie of internet. Of op andere manieren een uitlaatklep zoeken. Geweld naar hulpverleners, drank, drugs, geweldplegingen, vandalisme, brandjes stichten en zelf   maken met bv. wasbenzine of een recept op internet. Mijn 3 tips: 1) pak in EU-verband het zeer zware   aan, 2) zet in op positieve communicatie en hoe je een goede jaarwisseling viert en 3) vraag de vuurwerksector met een 5- of 10jarenplan te komen voor duurzame productontwikkeling.\\nVerbod op   werkt niet.

Zou het misschien een idee zijn om ter compensatie voor deze groep liefhebbers een derde categorie te introduceren naast GV en PSE, een certificaat (soort rijbewijs) te introduceren waardoor zij wel F2   kunnen kopen en afsteken, maar alleen tijdens oud en nieuw? Dan kunnen er regels geïntroduceerd worden dat   alleen verkocht mag worden aan certificaathouders en zo sluit je de groep die het verpesten grotendeels uit. De politie kan dan handhaven door het certificaat te controleren tijdens het vervoer  of afsteken, zodat mensen met   en zonder certificaat beboet kunnen worden. En bij het afgeven van deze certificaat kan ook een theorie en praktijk examen afgenomen worden. Let wel op dat dit vele malen laagdrempeliger moet zijn dan de huidige 'Groot Vuurwerk' en 'Pyrotechnische Speciale Effecten'. Deze liefhebbers kunnen dan in hun eigen gemeente een vuurwerkshow geven tijdens oud en nieuw op een door de gemeente goedgekeurde locatie voor een publiek.
